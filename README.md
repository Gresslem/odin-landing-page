# odin-landing-page
I am making a landing page for a "fake" website.
I may use this in the future if I ever decide to start my own business.
I will officially be staring this project tomorrow 11/15/2023.

It is the landing page for my business "Loucifer Productions".

Just kidding started this on 11/17.

Having trouble geting the call to action to center itslef on the page.
Scrapped the call container and starting on the header. 11/18

With the top of the page and bottom of the page built the way I want for now, I'm gonna get the layout done based on the Odin Project's finished look and work on it from there.

Bare bones structure was built on 11/19. Tomorrow will start the customization process. Odds are the start will be Tuesday. The website will be for my production company, for my audio projects, or just projects that I produce.

Project was finished 11/21. Here are my final thoughts/reflection:

I thought starting from the bottom up up would make creating this landing page easier, but it turned out that going top down was the smarter route. The upper area feeds into the other areas, because the tasks you complete trickle down into the other areas of the web page. Some things were easier than others. Getting the Call to Action section to work was the most frustrating and was the cause of my method changing.

Still not really sure what the read me is 100% for but I'll do it the best way I know how.

Thank you for reading and looking at my first official landing page.
