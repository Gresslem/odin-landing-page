# odin-landing-page
I am making a landing page for a "fake" website.
I may use this in the future if I ever decide to start my own business.
I will officially be staring this project tomorrow 11/15/2023.

It is the landing page for my business "Loucifer Productions".

Just kidding started this on 11/17.

Having trouble geting the call to action to center itslef on the page.
Scrapped the call container and starting on the header. 11/18

With the top of the page and bottom of the page built the way I want for now, I'm gonna get the layout done based on the Odin Project's finished look and work on it from there.

Bare bones structure was built on 11/19. Tomorrow will start the customization process. Odds are the start will be Tuesday. The website will be for my production company, for my audio projects, or just projects that I produce.
